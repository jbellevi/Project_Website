To be or not to be, that is the question;
Whether tis nobler in the mind to
Suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles and 
by opposing end them
(I know that this is suppose to be iambic pentameter but I don't
have the energy to space this out)
To die; to sleep; no more
and by a sleep to say we end the heartaches and thousand
natural shocks to which flesh is heir. Tis a consummation
devoutly to be wished. To die. To sleep.

To sleep perchance to dream, aye, there's the rub
For in this sleep of death what dreams may come
Once we have shuffled off this mortal coil
Must give us pause. There's the respect that makes
Calamity of so long life.

For who would bear the whips and scorns of time
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, the insolence of office,
The spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes
If he himself could his quietus make with a bear bodkin.

Who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life
But for the dread of something after death  
The undiscovered country of whose bourne no traveller returns
Puzzles the will and makes use rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others we know not of.

Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, and
The native hue of resolution is sicklied over with the pale cast of thought.
And entreprises of great pitch and moment in this their currents turn awry
and lose the name of ACTION.
